Nexus Design Guidelines v2.0

Ruthlessly Simple. Adaptive. Couple-First.


---

1. Core Philosophy

Nexus is not a finance app—it’s a financial co-op coach for couples. The design must feel:

Non-judgmental (no guilt, no shaming).

Collaborative (everything is “we” not “me vs. you”).

Adaptive (plans bend to reality, not the other way around).

Ruthlessly simple (always one clear action, one clear number, one clear next step).

2. Behavioral Principles

The Nexus Loop

1. Observe → Capture spending/income.


2. Adapt → Coach recalculates buckets automatically.


3. Reinforce → Positive feedback + micro-wins.


4. Celebrate Together → Shared XP, milestones, rituals.



📌 Rule: Every feature must reinforce this loop.

Feedback Horizons

Daily Sparks: Streaks, nudges, “nice work” animations.

Weekly Reset: Fresh allocation, adaptive rebalancing.

Monthly Milestones: Bigger wins, stage unlocks, badges.


Stage-Gated Journey (Crawl → Walk → Run → Fly)

Crawl: Track essentials + income baseline.

Walk: Buckets unlocked + SpendableHero live.

Run: Shared goals + automation layered in.

Fly: Advanced tools (Pledge Protocol, Accords Hub, investments).


📌 Rule: Each stage introduces max 2 new behaviors. No overwhelm.

3. Visual Identity

Primary Palette

Blueprint Navy (#1B2A41): Stability, trust, clarity.

Blueprint Sky (#6BAED6): Calm, approachable data.

Volt Yellow (#FCDC3C): Optimism, energy, sparks of progress.

Volt Green (#24C97A): Growth, wins, “you’re on track.”

Volt Coral (#FF6F61): Friendly prompts, attention without guilt.


Secondary / Neutrals

Soft White (#FAFAFA): Clean background.

Slate Gray (#7D8A99): Neutral copy, calm contrast.

Charcoal Black (#121212): Hero text & anchoring UI.


📌 Rule: Volt = action/highlight, Blueprint = base/comfort.

4. UI Guidelines

Layout

Hero Number First: SpendableHero is always central.

Progressive Disclosure: Complexity hidden until relevant.

Generous Spacing: Emotional comfort > density.


Typography

Headlines: Bold, large, clear (comfort over precision).

Body Copy: Short, warm, conversational (coach-like).

Numerals: Always with context, never floating (“$73 left for us this week” > “$73”).


Motion & Feedback

Micro-Animations: Checkmarks, confetti, pulsing glow.

Celebratory Rituals: Stage unlocks use fireworks/animations.

Soft Warnings: Coral highlights with constructive phrasing.



---

5. Language & Tone

Always collaborative: “We’ve got $120 free to play with this week.”

Always forward-focused: “Next week is a fresh start.”

Always positive reinforcement: Celebrate actions, not just outcomes.


📌 Rule: No shame. No red. No blame.


---

6. Gamification

Shared XP Bar: Couples level up together.

Micro-Challenges: “Cook dinner once = $20 win.”

Shared Badges: “Teamwork Triumph,” “Emergency Shield Builder.”

Annual Impact Visuals: Show how small weekly choices compound.


📌 Rule: All gamification is cooperative, never competitive.

7. Do’s and Don’ts

✅ Do show one clear number (SpendableHero).
✅ Do frame everything in terms of “we.”
✅ Do celebrate micro-actions.
❌ Don’t shame overspending.
❌ Don’t show partner-specific blame.
❌ Don’t overwhelm with raw data early.
